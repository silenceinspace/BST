# BST
Practice bulding a BST 

Things to repeat myself over and over again:
1. In order to solve a problem, I first need to break it down as much as possible. I need to UNDERSTAND what I am trying to solve.
2. It is better to write out my solution on paper before I get down to coding. (because it's going to be transferable knowledge — problem solving — to the future, not depending on the syntax of a programming language)
3. Analyze all possible cases not to "hardcode" things. Things should work IN GENERAL, not UNDER SPECIFIC CONDITIONS.
4. Set more clear objectives for my study sessions (Sitting in front of my monitor for a few hours with no intentions is a waste of time)
5. It is okay to google things I once learned but no longer remember (E.g. syntax, arguments' meanings)
